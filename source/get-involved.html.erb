    		<h2>Volunteer for Measure E</h2>

            <p>Measure E will require businesses to offer any available additional hours to their current, qualified part-time employees before hiring more workers.</p>

            <p>We need your help to talk to voters and spread the word about the Opportunity to Work initiative. There's a lot on the ballot this year, so we have to make sure voters "don't stop at the top" and vote Yes on E.</p>

            <p class="big-text big-text--yellow">Join us to pass Measure E, so hourly workers can get enough hours of work to put food on the table for their families.</p>
